# Meta AI Glasses Integration (Placeholder)

Tracked in `tracking/PR-033-meta-ai-glasses-audio-routing.md`.

## Target
Build a small “audio diagnostics” view inside the mobile app that:
- shows current audio route
- records a short sample
- plays it back through the active route (ideally bluetooth headset)

## TODO
- iOS route display + record/play
- Android route display + record/play
