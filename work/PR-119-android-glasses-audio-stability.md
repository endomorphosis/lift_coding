# PR-120: iOS autolinking and WAV correctness

## Summary
Ensure the `expo-glasses-audio` native module autolinks correctly on iOS and make WAV handling standards-compliant, including support for backend-generated files that contain additional metadata chunks.

## Changes
- iOS autolinking:
  - Update the iOS native module configuration so that `expo-glasses-audio` is discovered and linked automatically by React Native autolinking.
  - Verify the CocoaPods / Xcode project integration so that no manual project edits are required when adding the module to a new app.
  - Document any minimum Xcode / iOS deployment target requirements for the module.
- WAV correctness:
  - Align the WAV parser with the RIFF/WAVE specification (header validation, chunk alignment, and size checks).
  - Support additional non-audio chunks (e.g., metadata) before the `data` chunk without breaking playback.
  - Add defensive checks and consistent error reporting when malformed WAV files are encountered.

## Test plan
- Build the iOS app (including the Expo dev-client) with `expo-glasses-audio` included and confirm that no manual linking steps are required.
- In a fresh React Native/Expo project:
  - Add `expo-glasses-audio` and run `pod install`, then confirm the module appears and functions on iOS without manual Xcode changes.
  - Record and play back a WAV generated by the module on-device.
  - Play back a backend-generated WAV that may include metadata chunks and verify correct audio playback without crashes or warnings in the logs.
