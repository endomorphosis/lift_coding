# LRA Thompson sampling

`nca_rankers.thompson_rank` samples `Beta(α,β)` per pipeline stem (two gammas).

- CALL `ptr://skill/port_thompson`. Syncs Bayes counts if empty, then writes `nca.pipeline_bias` from draws.
- Use when the mean would starve a rarely tried stem. Lake still admits. Never docker0.
